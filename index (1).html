        <h2>Formula 1 for Rookies</h2>
        <p>
            Formula 1 began as a world championship competition in 1950, with the first race held on May 13, 1950, at the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom, a former Royal Air Force base. Six more races were held in the season that saw Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe 'Nino' Farina win the sport's first world champion, defeating teammates Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli. 
        </p>
      <p>   
      While motorsport had existed since the late 1800s, with Grand Prix events coming and rising in popularity over the following decades, the formal F1 championship that exists today began in 1950.

      The present system of Formula One World Championship points scoring was adopted in 2010 and has been continuing since.

According to this system, the top 10 drivers at the end of each Grand Prix will receive points based on the positions they finished and these points will contribute towards determining both, the World Drivers’ and World Constructors’ Championships at the end of the season.</p>
<p>
The winner receives 25 points (25 Drivers' Championship points as well as 25 Constructors' Championship points) and other drivers receive points according to the following table:

      If both cars of a team finish in the top 10, they both contribute to the Constructors’ Championship points
    </p>
